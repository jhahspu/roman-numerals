Simple conversion tool. Thanks to my neighbour for waking me up at 1am.. so I put on a movie, hoping that I'll fall asleep and saw the MCMLX logo(or whatever it means), and because I always forget how to read beyond 39, I made this tool.. :D 
As for rules: work only with basic info from wiki and NO picking at other solutions.
